# Sleep Spindle Detection
This is a personal project intended for upskilling in Biosignal processing . Sleep Spindle is an event in EEG signals that occurs in the frequency band of 11 to 16 Hz. The time window for it occurence is 0.5 seconds to 3 second by some literatures available

## Goals 
1. Understanding the Characteristics of Sleep Spindles 
2. Exploratory data analysis on the EEG data used from kaggle
3. Developing algorithms to detect sleep spindle
